# Project Proxie
Yes, this is another project.
No, I do not know what I'm doing.

This bot is hosted using Render, a free web service hosting platform.

The uptime monitor can be found [here](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/qPbaPTqa4R).
The frontend can be found [here](https://project-proxie.onrender.com/). However, I do not intend to work on the frontend just yet.
